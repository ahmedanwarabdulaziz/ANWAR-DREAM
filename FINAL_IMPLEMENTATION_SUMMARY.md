## 🚀 **How to Use**

### **1. Create a Business**
```typescript
import { BusinessService } from '@/lib/businessService'

const business = await BusinessService.createBusiness({
  name: "Coffee Shop",
  ownerId: "BC2085",
  email: "owner@coffee.com"
})
// Automatically creates 2 permanent classes with QR codes!
```

### **2. Customer Signs Up via Referral**
```
Customer A shares: https://yourapp.com/signup?ref=BC2085&b=BIZ001
Customer B clicks and signs up
→ Assigned to correct class (based on routing)
→ Customer A gets referrer points
→ Customer B gets welcome + referred points
```

### **3. View Referral Links**
Customers can see their referral links on the dashboard:
- Link to copy/share
- QR code to download/print
- Referral statistics

### **4. Manual Class Migration**
```typescript
import { ClassMigrationService } from '@/lib/classMigrationService'

await ClassMigrationService.manualMigration(
  "BC2085",     // customerId
  "BIZ001",     // businessId
  "CLASS003",   // newClassId
  "Promoted to VIP" // notes
)
```

### **5. Automatic Migration Trigger**
```typescript
await ClassMigrationService.createMigrationTrigger({
  businessId: "BIZ001",
  fromClassId: "CLASS001",
  toClassId: "CLASS003",
  triggerType: "points_threshold",
  thresholdValue: 1000 // Migrate when customer reaches 1000 points
})
```
