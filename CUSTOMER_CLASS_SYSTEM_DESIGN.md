# üéØ Customer Class & Referral System - Complete Design

## üìã Overview

This document outlines the complete customer class and referral system for businesses. Each business can create unlimited customer classes, manage referrals, and track customer relationships across multiple businesses.

## üí∞ **Permanent Points Conversion Rule**

**CRITICAL BUSINESS RULE:**
```
100 Points = $1.00 USD
```
This is a **permanent, system-wide rule** that applies to:
- Point redemption calculations
- Cash value conversions
- Reward pricing
- All financial transactions

---

## üèóÔ∏è **Database Schema**

### **1. Businesses Collection** (`/businesses/{businessId}`)

```json
{
  "businessId": "BIZ001", // Auto-generated: BIZ + 4 digits
  "name": "Coffee Shop Downtown",
  "ownerId": "BC2085", // Customer ID of business owner
  "email": "owner@coffeeshop.com",
  "phone": "+1234567890",
  "address": "123 Main St, City, State",
  "businessType": "restaurant",
  "website": "https://coffeeshop.com",
  "isActive": true,
  "createdAt": "2025-10-28T17:28:45.123Z",
  "settings": {
    "pointsToDollarRate": 100, // PERMANENT: 100 points = $1
    "allowCustomClasses": true,
    "defaultReferralRouting": "referral_class", // Options: "referral_class", "referrer_class", "custom"
    "customReferralClassId": null // Used if defaultReferralRouting = "custom"
  }
}
```

### **2. Customer Classes Collection** (`/businesses/{businessId}/customerClasses/{classId}`)

```json
{
  "classId": "CLASS001", // Auto-generated: CLASS + 6 digits
  "businessId": "BIZ001",
  "name": "General Customers",
  "type": "permanent", // "permanent" or "custom"
  "description": "Regular customers who visit our store",
  "isActive": true,
  "createdAt": "2025-10-28T17:28:45.123Z",
  
  // QR Code & Signup Link (Permanent, Server-Based)
  "qrCode": {
    "data": "https://yourapp.com/signup?b=BIZ001&c=CLASS001", // Server URL
    "imageUrl": "https://cloudinary.com/qr/BIZ001_CLASS001.png"
  },
  "signupLink": "https://yourapp.com/signup?b=BIZ001&c=CLASS001",
  
  // Points Configuration
  "points": {
    "welcomePoints": 100, // Points given when customer joins this class
    "referrerPoints": 50, // Points given to person who made referral
    "referredPoints": 50 // Points given to person who was referred
  },
  
  // Benefits & Settings
  "benefits": {
    "pointsMultiplier": 1.0, // Multiply earned points (e.g., 1.5 = 50% bonus)
    "discountPercentage": 0, // Discount percentage on purchases
    "specialOffers": true, // Enable special offers for this class
    "freeShipping": false,
    "earlyAccess": false
  },
  
  // Analytics (Calculated fields)
  "analytics": {
    "totalCustomers": 0,
    "totalPointsDistributed": 0,

  }
}
```

**Permanent Classes (Auto-created):**
- `"General Customers"` - Default class for regular signups
- `"Referral Customers"` - Default class for referrals (unless routing changes)

### **3. Customers-Businesses Relationships** (`/customers/{customerId}/businesses/{businessId}`)

```json
{
  "customerId": "BC2085",
  "businessId": "BIZ001",
  "customerClassId": "CLASS001",
  "joinedAt": "2025-10-28T17:28:45.123Z",
  "status": "active", // "active", "inactive", "suspended"
  
  // Points & Activity
  "totalPoints": 250,
  "totalPointsEarned": 250,
  "totalPointsRedeemed": 0,
  "totalPointsValue": 2.50, // Calculated: totalPoints / 100 (always $)
  "totalVisits": 12,
  "lastVisit": "2025-10-28T17:28:45.123Z",
  
  // Referral Information
  "referrerId": null, // Customer ID who referred this customer (if applicable)
  "referredBy": null, // Class ID from which referral happened (if applicable)
  "referralDate": null,
  
  // Class History (for migration tracking)
  "classHistory": [
    {
      "classId": "CLASS001",

    }
  ],
  
  // Custom Notes
  "notes": "VIP customer, always orders large coffee",
  "tags": ["vip", "regular"]
}
```

**Important:** Customers can have MULTIPLE entries (one per business), stored in:
```
/customers/{customerId}/businesses/{businessId}
```

### **4. Referral Tracking** (`/businesses/{businessId}/referrals/{referralId}`)

```json
{
  "referralId": "REF001",
  "businessId": "BIZ001",
  "referrerId": "BC2085", // Customer who made the referral
  "referredId": "BC2086", // Customer who was referred
  "referrerClassId": "CLASS001", // Class of the person who referred
  "assignedClassId": "CLASS002", // Class the referred person was assigned to
  "referralRouting": "referral_class", // How it was routed
  "status": "completed", // "pending", "completed", "failed"
  "createdAt": "2025-10-28T17:28:45.123Z",
  "completedAt": "2025-10-28T17:30:12.456Z",
  "pointsDistributed": {
    "referrerReceived": 50,
    "referredReceived": 50,
    "distributedAt": "2025-10-28T17:30:12.456Z"
  }
}
```

### **5. Customer Personal Referral Links** (`/customers/{customerId}/referralLinks/{businessId}`)

```json
{
  "customerId": "BC2085",
  "businessId": "BIZ001",
  "currentClassId": "CLASS001",
  "referralLink": "https://yourapp.com/signup?ref=BC2085&b=BIZ001",
  "qrCode": {
    "data": "https://yourapp.com/signup?ref=BC2085&b=BIZ001",
    "imageUrl": "https://cloudinary.com/qr/REF_BC2085_BIZ001.png"
  },
  "totalReferrals": 5,

  "lastUsed": "2025-10-28T17:28:45.123Z"
}
```

**Note:** Each customer has a personal referral link for EACH business they're part of.

### **6. Class Migration Log** (`/businesses/{businessId}/classMigrations/{migrationId}`)

```json
{
  "migrationId": "MIG001",
  "businessId": "BIZ001",

## üîÑ **Complete System Flow**

### **Scenario 1: Business Registration**

1. Business owner signs up with `role: 'business'`
2. System generates unique Business ID: `BIZ001`
3. Creates business document in `/businesses/BIZ001`
4. **Automatically creates 2 permanent classes:**
   - "General Customers" (CLASS001)
     - Welcome Points: 100
     - Referrer Points: 0 (default)
     - Referred Points: 0 (default)
   - "Referral Customers" (CLASS002)
     - Welcome Points: 100
     - Referrer Points: 50 (default)
     - Referred Points: 50 (default)
5. Generates permanent QR codes and signup links for both classes
6. Business can customize points and settings immediately

### **Scenario 2: Direct Customer Signup (No Referral)**

2. Signup form pre-fills:
   - Business: BIZ001
   - Customer Class: CLASS001 (General Customers)
   - Referrer: None
3. Customer completes registration
4. System creates:
   - User account in `/users/{customerId}`
   - Relationship in `/customers/{customerId}/businesses/BIZ001`
   - Assigns customer to CLASS001
5. **Points Distribution:**
   - Customer receives: `CLASS001.welcomePoints` (e.g., 100 points)
   - Points transaction logged
   - Analytics updated

### **Scenario 3: Referral Signup - Default Routing (Referral Class)**

**Business Settings:**
```json
{
  "defaultReferralRouting": "referral_class"
}
```

**Flow:**

2. Customer A shares their referral link: `https://yourapp.com/signup?ref=BC2085&b=BIZ001`
3. Customer B clicks link and signs up
4. System identifies:
   - Referrer: BC2085 (from CLASS001)
   - Business: BIZ001
   - Routing: "referral_class"
5. Customer B is assigned to CLASS002 (Referral Customers)
6. **Points Distribution:**
   - Customer A (referrer) receives: `CLASS001.referrerPoints` (e.g., 50 points)
   - Customer B (referred) receives: `CLASS002.referredPoints` (e.g., 50 points) + `CLASS002.welcomePoints` (e.g., 100 points)
7. Referral record created in `/businesses/BIZ001/referrals/REF001`
8. Customer A's referral link analytics updated

### **Scenario 4: Referral Signup - Same Class Routing**

**Business Settings:**
```json
{
  "defaultReferralRouting": "referrer_class"
}
```

**Flow:**
1. Customer A (BC2085) is in CLASS003 (VIP Customers)
2. Customer A shares referral link
3. Customer B signs up through referral
4. System assigns Customer B to **CLASS003** (same as referrer)
5. **Points Distribution:**
   - Customer A receives: `CLASS003.referrerPoints` (e.g., 100 points)
   - Customer B receives: `CLASS003.referredPoints` (e.g., 100 points) + `CLASS003.welcomePoints` (e.g., 200 points)

### **Scenario 5: Referral Signup - Custom Class Routing**

**Business Settings:**
```json
{
  "defaultReferralRouting": "custom",
  "customReferralClassId": "CLASS004" // "Special Promotion Class"
}
```

**Flow:**
1. Customer A (any class) shares referral link
2. Customer B signs up through referral
3. System assigns Customer B to **CLASS004** (custom selected class)
4. **Points Distribution:**
   - Customer A receives: Points from their own class (`referrerClass.referrerPoints`)
   - Customer B receives: Points from assigned class (`CLASS004.referredPoints + CLASS004.welcomePoints`)

### **Scenario 6: Class Migration - Task Completion**

1. Business creates task: "Complete 10 visits to upgrade to VIP"
2. Customer completes task
3. System creates migration record
4. Customer moved from CLASS001 ‚Üí CLASS003
5. Class history updated
6. Customer keeps all existing points

### **Scenario 7: Class Migration - Manual (Business Dashboard)**

1. Business owner opens customer profile
2. Business selects: "Move to VIP Class"
3. System creates migration record
4. Customer moved to new class
5. Points multiplier and benefits updated immediately

### **Scenario 8: Customer Joins Multiple Businesses**

1. Customer BC2085 is already part of BIZ001 (Coffee Shop)
2. Customer BC2085 signs up for BIZ002 (Pizza Place) via their referral link
3. System creates: `/customers/BC2085/businesses/BIZ002`
4. Customer now has **two separate relationships:**
   - BIZ001: CLASS001, 250 points
   - BIZ002: CLASS001, 100 points (welcome points)
5. Customer has **two personal referral links:**
   - One for BIZ001
   - One for BIZ002
6. Points and analytics tracked separately per business
